💻 PHP-Server-Environment
Small login dashboard using Bootstrap´s SB Admin 2 using PHP. The application fakes a database with usernames and passwords and allows to log in and out using several messages and expressions. I used superglobal variables, like session.

🕹 User
Start the web using index.php.

🕺🏻♫♪ Who doesn´t like a bit of Fredy Mercury every now and then. To use the fake database, just log in with the user "Galileo", the email "scaramouche@willyoudothefandango.com" and the password "priscila". The app logs you in and gives the option of logging out as well. You can navigate through the different components and please... Give me your highest note 🎤😎
